  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Controller</h2>
  <p>The controller responsible for data processing under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:</p>
  <address>

  <h2>2. Data Processing in the App</h2>
  <p>The app <strong>"Cave Map"</strong> uses your deviceâ€™s location data solely to display your current position on the map and calculate distances to nearby caves. This location data is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Processed entirely <strong>locally</strong> on your device at runtime;</li>
    <li>Stored only in memory while the app is active (no persistent storage to disk);</li>
    <li>Never transmitted to any server or third party;</li>
    <li>Not linked to any other personal information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On first launch, the standard iOS permission dialog will request your explicit consent to access location data. You may choose to allow access only while using the app or deny it; if denied, location-based features will be unavailable.</p>

  <h2>3. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses map data provided by OpenStreetMap. On the first launch, map data is downloaded to allow offline use. No personal data is transmitted to OpenStreetMap or any third party.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>
  <p>The processing of your location data is based on your <strong>explicit consent</strong> in accordance with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR</a>. Consent is obtained via the iOS system permission prompt. No further legal basis is required for this runtime-only, on-device processing.</p>

  <h2>5. Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
  <p>Because the app does not store or transmit personal data, the following rights are largely academic. Nevertheless, under the GDPR you retain the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your personal data (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Request erasure of personal data (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Request restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These rights apply if and to the extent that any personal data were processed.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy to reflect changes in legal requirements or app functionality. The latest version is always accessible within the app and on the App Store.</p>
